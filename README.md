# Chart-creator
Chart creator is a program that permits to create, modifiy and save 3 types of chart: bar-charts, pie-charts and spline charts.
## GUI
The GUI is composed by differents tabs, every tab represent one project. Tab can be closed but when they are closed the content is not going to be saved so remember to save it before closing the tab.
### Saving a project
The project can be saved in 4 different ways:
1. By clicking the first button of the toolbar; this action will result in a simple save
2. Simple save can be performed also by using the action in the file menu named *"Save this"*
3. To save all opened tabs you can click on the action *"Save all"* in the file menu
4. The last way to save a file consists in a *"Save as..."* action an it can be done by clicking the second button of the toolbar

The other two buttons of the toolbar will respectively save an image of the chart and change the theme of the chart (light or dark). The title of the chart can be changed using the textbox located above the chart.

The GUI of a bar chart consists of a list of rows made for categories and a group of tabs that contains data for each category. Data is made up by a label and a number. With the button *"Edit rows"* it's possible to modify rows in different ways. The way you can modify rows changes based on the type of row you are modifying; for categories you can only delete one row instead for data rows you can also change the color that will respresent that label on the chart like shown in the following picture:

### Pie-chart GUI
The pie-chart GUI differs from the previous one because it doesn't need categories.
### Spline-chart GUI
The spline-chart GUI differs from the others becuase it  doesn't need categories and because data is no more represented by labels and numbers but only by two numbers that represent the point you want to represent on the plane.
